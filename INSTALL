GLIP Installation
=================

libglip uses GNU autotools, the build and installation process
is straightforward.

Run the following commands inside the top-level source directory to
build GLIP with the cypressfx2 and tcp backends and install it
to /opt/glip. See the documentation of the individual backends for
configure options and third-party library dependencies.

$> ./autogen.sh
$> mkdir build; cd build
$> ../configure --prefix=/opt/glip --enable-cypressfx2 --enable-tcp
$> make
$> make install

Building the Documentation
---------------------------

GLIP contains extensive documentation, which can be generated using doxygen.
First, choose which output formats of the documentation you want and pass
those options to the configure script. Inside the build directory, run
$> ../configure --help | grep doxygen
for a list of all available options. By default only the HTML documentation
is built (which is also the most useful output format).

After running configure, build the API documentation by running
$> make doc

All resulting documentation will be inside the build/apidoc folder.
To view the HTML documentation, open build/apidoc/html/index.html in your
browser, e.g. by calling
$> firefox apidoc/html/index.html
