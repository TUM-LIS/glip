GLIP Installation
=================

libglip uses GNU autotools, the build and installation process 
is straightforward.

Run the following commands inside the top-level source directory to 
build GLIP with the cypressfx2 and tcp backends and install it 
to /opt/glip. See the documentation of the individual backends for
configure options and third-party library dependencies.

$> ./autogen.sh
$> mkdir build; cd build
$> ../configure --prefix=/opt/glip --enable-cypressfx2 --enable-tcp
$> make
$> make install
