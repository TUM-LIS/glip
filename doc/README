GLIP Documentation Guidelines
=============================

We generate two types of documentation from the same sources:
- the API documentation for the users of the GLIP API
- the documentation for developers of GLIP itself, mainly people writing
  new backends.

The internal developer's documentation contains the API documentation. 
Additional internal documentation is added using the Doxygen tag "@internal".

Functions, structs, etc. that should not be part of any documentation (e.g. 
that are an implementation detail not required by API users or backend 
developers) can be marked with @private and will be present in neither of the
two documentation types.
